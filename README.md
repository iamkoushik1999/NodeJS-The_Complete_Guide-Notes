# NodeJS-The Complete Guide Notes 


### What is JavaScript?

> It's a programming Language, we typically use in the browser to manipulate your DOM, to manipulate the page which was loaded in the browser

### Node Js

> It's a different version of javaScript, it is basically built on JavaScript, it adds some features to it, is not capable of doing some other things you can do with javaScript in the browser, so it basically takes javascript and puts it into a different environment 

### How does it work?

> Node Js uses V8 and V8 simply is the name of the javascript engine built by Google, that runs javascript in the browser

### What does V8 do?

> It takes that JavaScript code and compiles it to machine code

### Write something in different file with Node Js

> 1st we have to import 'fs' file system module with **require('fs')** and store that witn
> **const fs = require('fs')**
>and then call a method of 'fs' called **writefileSync** and then the path ('hello.txt',"Hello to Node Js")
