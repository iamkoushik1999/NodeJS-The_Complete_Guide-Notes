# NodeJS-The Complete Guide Notes 


### What is JavaScript?

> It's a programming Language, we typically use in the browser to manipulate your DOM, to manipulate the page which was loaded in the browser

### Node Js

> It's a different version of javaScript, it is basically built on JavaScript, it adds some features to it, is not capable of doing some other things you can do with javaScript in the browser, so it basically takes javascript and puts it into a different environment 

### How does it work?

> Node Js uses V8 and V8 simply is the name of the javascript engine built by Google, that runs javascript in the browser

### What does V8 do?

> It takes that JavaScript code and compiles it to machine code

### Write something in different file with Node Js

> 1st we have to import 'fs' file system module with **require('fs')** and store that witn

> **const fs = require('fs')**

>and then call a method of 'fs' called **writefileSync** and then the path ('hello.txt',"Hello to Node Js")

### JavaScript Summery

|Weakly Typed Language|Object Oriented Language|Versatile Language|
|---------------------|------------------------|------------------|
|No explicit type assignment|Data can be organized in logical Objects|Runs in Browser and directly on a PC/Server|
|Data type can be switched dynamically|Primitive and Reference type|Can perform a broad varity of task|

> Weakly typed means - 

> JavaScript knows types like number or text which is called sting or boolean shich is true or false but it doesn't force you to define which type you are using in a variable or in a function

> Object Oriented means - 

> Data can be organized in logical objects

> Versatile Language means - 

> JavaScript runs on Browser and this is were it comes from but also JavaScript can be used with Node Js to run it on your PC outside of a browser or also on a server day of work
